# scRNA-seq-DEG-analysis-on-traumatic-brain-tissue

CS 185 class project 

Presented on and conducted novel scRNA-seq differential gene expression analysis with Seurat in control and traumatic brain tissue, revealing significant associations in schizophrenia and depression
Improved upon previous methods of analysis by using the Leiden algorithm to cluster cells, and MAST method to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
